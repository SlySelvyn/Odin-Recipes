<p>The Burger, the mighty American sandwich.</p>
<p>A burger is a culinary masterpiece that begins with a tender and juicy ground meat patty, typically beef, but sometimes chicken, turkey, or even plant-based alternatives. It's seasoned to perfection, delivering a mouthwatering blend of flavors that dance on your taste buds. The patty is then sandwiched between two fluffy buns, with a variety of toppings to choose from, such as cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and sauces.</p>
