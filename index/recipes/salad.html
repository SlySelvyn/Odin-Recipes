    <p>Caesar salad is a classic and popular dish known for its crisp and fresh combination of ingredients. It typically consists of crisp romaine lettuce leaves tossed with Caesar dressing, which is a rich and creamy dressing made with ingredients like olive oil, garlic, Dijon mustard, anchovies, Parmesan cheese, and lemon juice. The salad is often topped with croutons for a crunchy texture and grated Parmesan cheese for added flavor. Some variations may include grilled chicken or bacon for additional protein and taste. The result is a satisfying salad that balances the creaminess of the dressing with the crispness of the lettuce and the savory notes from Parmesan and anchovies.</p>
